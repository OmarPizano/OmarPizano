ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am @OmarPizano. Currently finishing my computer systems engineer degree.

## About Me ðŸ¤µ

I am deeply interested in cybersecurity and DevOps. I love helping people and 
finding creative ways to solve problems. In my free time I like to learn and test
new things on my own (homelab). Also like to go outside and have fun with my friends
from time to time.

I would like to work in cybersecurity one day but, before I get there, I am developing
some of the following skills.

## Currently Learning ðŸ¤º

- [ ] TODO: Soon I will put some links to my work!!

- WebDev (PHP, MVC, Laravel)
- Programming (C, Python, Bash, Assembly)
- Networking
- Cloud (GCP, Docker, Kubernetes)
- SysAdmin, DevOps (GNU/Linux, Windows Active Directory)
- Cybersecurity (Pentesting, BugBounty, AppSec, Reversing, etc.)

## Colaboration ðŸ’ž

Iâ€™m looking to voluntarily collaborate on any project that could give me hands-on 
experience in any of the previous mentioned subjects, specially cybersecurity and
DevOps.

## Internship ðŸ’¼

Currently looking for an internship. The roles I am targeting are:
- Tier 1/2 Helpdesk Support
- System Administrator/Engineer
- Network Engineer
- Backend Software Developer
- Any junior security-based role
