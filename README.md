## About Me ðŸ¤µ

I am deeply interested in cybersecurity and DevOps. I love helping people and 
finding creative ways to solve problems. In my free time I like to learn and test
new things on my own (homelab). Also like to go outside and have fun with my friends
from time to time.

I would like to work in cybersecurity one day but, before I get there, I am developing
some of the following skills.

## Colaboration ðŸ’ž

Iâ€™m looking to voluntarily collaborate on any project that could give me hands-on 
experience in any of the previous mentioned subjects, specially cybersecurity and
DevOps.

## Internship ðŸ’¼

Currently looking for an internship. The roles I am targeting are:
- HelpDesk/SupportDesk
- WebDev (backend)
